## Alias Usage

This rule encourages the use of the `@` alias for all imports originating from the `src` directory. Using aliases helps to:

-   **Improve Readability**: Shortens long relative paths (e.g., `../../../utils/http` becomes `@/utils/http`).
-   **Enhance Maintainability**: Makes refactoring easier as file locations change, without needing to update numerous relative paths.
-   **Provide Clarity**: Clearly indicates that an import is from the project's source root.

Avoid using relative paths (`../`, `./`) for imports that reach outside the current module's immediate scope and into other top-level `src` directories.

### Patterns:

```json
[
  {
    "path": "src/**/*.ts",
    "regex": "import\\s+. *\\s+from\\s+['"]\\.\.\/",
    "message": "Prefer using the '@' alias for imports from the 'src' directory instead of relative paths (e.g., `import ... from '@/utils/http';`)."
  }
]
```

```
