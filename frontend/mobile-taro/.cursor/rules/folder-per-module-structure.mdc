## Folder-per-Module Structure

This rule enforces a consistent modular structure across the project. Every major functional unit, such as pages, global components, API services, and global state stores, must reside within its own dedicated folder. The name of this folder should clearly indicate the purpose of the module.

This approach enhances code organization, readability, and maintainability by grouping related files together.

### Patterns:

```json
[
  {
    "path": "src/pages/*",
    "type": "directory",
    "message": "Pages must be in their own folders (e.g., `src/pages/MyPage/`)."
  },
  {
    "path": "src/components/*",
    "type": "directory",
    "message": "Global components must be in their own folders (e.g., `src/components/MyComponent/`)."
  },
  {
    "path": "src/services/*",
    "type": "directory",
    "message": "API services must be in their own folders (e.g., `src/services/UserService/`)."
  },
  {
    "path": "src/stores/*",
    "type": "directory",
    "message": "Global stores must be in their own folders (e.g., `src/stores/UserStore/`)."
  }
]
```
