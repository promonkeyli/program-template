## Store Module Structure

This rule defines the internal structure for global state management modules (stores). Each store module folder must contain:

1.  `index.ts`: This file contains the actual Zustand store creation logic and actions.
2.  `type.ts`: This file is dedicated to defining all TypeScript interfaces and types that are relevant to the store's state and actions.

This separation ensures that the store's type definitions are clearly organized and distinct from its implementation, improving maintainability and clarity.

### Patterns:

```json
[
  {
    "path": "src/stores/*/index.ts",
    "type": "file",
    "message": "Store modules must have an `index.ts` for the store logic."
  },
  {
    "path": "src/stores/*/type.ts",
    "type": "file",
    "message": "Store modules must have a `type.ts` for related TypeScript types."
  }
]
```
