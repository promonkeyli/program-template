## Page Structure

This rule outlines the expected file and folder structure for each page in the application. A page's folder should serve as a self-contained unit for that page's functionality.

-   `index.tsx`: The main entry point for the page, acting as a container component.
-   `index.less`: Page-specific styles.
-   `index.config.ts`: Page-specific configuration (e.g., navigation bar title).
-   `components/`: An optional subfolder for components that are used exclusively within this page. These local components should also follow a folder-per-component structure.
-   `use*.ts`: Custom hooks that encapsulate the page's business logic, placed directly within the page's root folder.

This structure promotes modularity, making pages easier to understand, develop, and maintain.

### Patterns:

```json
[
  {
    "path": "src/pages/*/index.tsx",
    "type": "file",
    "message": "Each page must have an `index.tsx` as its entry point."
  },
  {
    "path": "src/pages/*/index.less",
    "type": "file",
    "message": "Each page must have an `index.less` for its styles."
  },
  {
    "path": "src/pages/*/index.config.ts",
    "type": "file",
    "message": "Each page must have an `index.config.ts` for its configuration."
  },
  {
    "path": "src/pages/*/components/*",
    "type": "directory",
    "message": "Local components for a page should be in a `components` subfolder (e.g., `src/pages/MyPage/components/MyLocalComponent/`)."
  },
  {
    "path": "src/pages/*/use*.ts",
    "type": "file",
    "message": "Custom hooks for a page should be placed directly in the page's folder (e.g., `src/pages/MyPage/useMyPageData.ts`)."
  }
]
```
