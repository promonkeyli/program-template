## Service Module Structure

This rule dictates the internal structure of service modules. To maintain a clear separation of concerns, each service module folder must contain two primary files:

1.  `index.ts`: This file is dedicated to implementing the actual API request functions.
2.  `type.ts`: This file is used for defining all TypeScript interfaces and types that are relevant to the service module's requests and responses.

This separation improves readability and makes it easier to manage type definitions independently from the API implementation logic.

### Patterns:

```json
[
  {
    "path": "src/services/*/index.ts",
    "type": "file",
    "message": "Service modules must have an `index.ts` for API functions."
  },
  {
    "path": "src/services/*/type.ts",
    "type": "file",
    "message": "Service modules must have a `type.ts` for related TypeScript types."
  }
]
```
